1. What is Python and why is it popular in Data Science?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. 
It is popular in Data Science due to its simple syntax, rich libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn), and strong community support.

2. Difference between List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary
	•	List: Ordered, mutable, allows duplicates
	•	Tuple: Ordered, immutable, allows duplicates
	•	Set: Unordered, mutable, no duplicates
	•	Dictionary: Key-value pairs, mutable, keys are unique

3. What is a Lambda function?

A lambda function is a small anonymous function written in a single line using the lambda keyword.

4. What is map(), filter(), reduce()?
	•	map(): Applies a function to each element
	•	filter(): Filters elements based on a condition
	•	reduce(): Aggregates elements into a single value

5. Difference between NumPy array and Python list
	•	NumPy arrays are faster, memory-efficient, and support vectorized operations
	•	Python lists are flexible but slower for numerical computation

6. What is Pandas used for?

Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, especially working with structured data like tables (DataFrames).

7. How do you handle missing values?
	•	Remove rows/columns
	•	Fill with mean/median/mode
	•	Forward or backward fill
	•	Use model-based imputation

8. Difference between loc and iloc
	•	loc: Label-based indexing
	•	iloc: Integer position-based indexing

9. What is Mean, Median, Mode?
	•	Mean: Average
	•	Median: Middle value
	•	Mode: Most frequent value

10. What is Variance and Standard Deviation?
	•	Variance: Measure of data spread from the mean
	•	Standard Deviation: Square root of variance

11. What is Correlation?

Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.

12. What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming.

13. Types of Machine Learning
	•	Supervised Learning
	•	Unsupervised Learning
	•	Semi-Supervised Learning
	•	Reinforcement Learning

14. Difference between Regression and Classification
	•	Regression: Predicts continuous values
	•	Classification: Predicts discrete class labels

15. What is Linear Regression?

A supervised learning algorithm that models the linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.

16. What are assumptions of Linear Regression?
	•	Linearity
	•	Independence
	•	Homoscedasticity
	•	Normality of errors
	•	No multicollinearity

17. What is R² score?

R² score measures how well the model explains the variance in the dependent variable.

18. What is Logistic Regression?

A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes using probability.

19. Why is sigmoid function used?

It converts output into a probability value between 0 and 1.

20. Difference between Linear and Logistic Regression
	•	Linear Regression predicts continuous values
	•	Logistic Regression predicts probabilities/classes

21. What is Margin in SVM?

Margin is the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data points.

22. What are Support Vectors?

Support Vectors are data points closest to the decision boundary that influence the model.

23. What is Kernel Trick?

Kernel trick transforms non-linear data into higher dimensions to make it linearly separable.

24. Types of Kernels
	•	Linear
	•	Polynomial
	•	RBF (Gaussian)
	•	Sigmoid

25. What is C parameter in SVM?

C controls the trade-off between maximizing margin and minimizing classification error.

26. What is Train-Test Split?

It is the process of dividing data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

27. Difference between Batch and Streaming
	•	Batch: Processes large data chunks at intervals
	•	Streaming: Processes data in real time

28. What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load—a process used in data pipelines to move and prepare data.

29. Difference between Bias and Variance
	•	Bias: Error due to oversimplified model
	•	Variance: Error due to model overfitting
